# Aeonian-Source
An unrestricted environment exploit for Roblox. Runs scripts at an identity of 6

This was the old Aeonian source that i am no longer working on due to how it is going to be superseded by Aeonian V4 which is an exploit that utilises a method of excecution called ProtoConversion founded by chirality in 2015

this is an exploit that utilises Autumns method of wrapping to achive execution on roblox
this exploit uses the same method of execution that other exploits use such as
Cyber v1/2/3/ \n
Axon v1 \n
Flame V3 \n
Bleu v1 \n
WRDAPI Lua Execution (not the restricted one) (Oh wait that is axon ha) \n

Old Exploits That Used The Same Method\n
Timber\n
Terv\n
Seraph\n
Synapse (in its beta, also the predesecor to raindrop)\n
Raindrop\n
